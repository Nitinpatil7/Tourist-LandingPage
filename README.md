## ðŸ”§ Backend (Express + MongoDB)

### ðŸ“Œ Description:
I created a simple backend using Node.js and Express. It has two main functionalities:

- `POST` data to MongoDB (for destinations and bestseller packages)
- `GET` data from MongoDB

### ðŸ“‚ Endpoints:

1. `POST /destination` â€“ to add a tourist destination  
2. `POST /bestseller` â€“ to add a bestseller package  
3. `GET /destination` â€“ to fetch all tourist destinations  
4. `GET /bestseller` â€“ to fetch all bestseller packages  

### ðŸ“¦ Packages used in backend:

- **express** â€“ for creating the server and routes  
- **mongoose** â€“ for connecting and working with MongoDB  
- **cors** â€“ to handle cross-origin requests  
- **dotenv** â€“ to manage environment variables  
- **body-parser** â€“ to handle form data  
- **nodemon** â€“ to run the server with auto-reload during development

## ðŸŽ¨ Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)

### ðŸ“Œ Description:
I built a simple home (landing) page using React. It fetches data from the backend and displays it nicely using components.

- Home page is divided into different components like Header, Hero, Destination Section, Bestseller Section, etc.
- I used some external images and React-icons to make the design more attractive.

### ðŸ“¦ Packages and tools used in frontend:

- **React** â€“ for building UI
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ for styling
- **React Icons** â€“ for using icons
